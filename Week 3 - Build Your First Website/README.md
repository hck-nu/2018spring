# More Things to Try
## Simple Additions
- Create a separate HTML page and link your home page to it.
- Change the color of the links when your mouse hovers over them.
- Modify changeBackground() so that it is guaranteed to change to a different color on each click.

## Less Simple Follow-ups
- Change the sections to be two-columns so that the heading of the section is one side and the main content is on the left (using Bootstrap, flexbox, or CSS Grid).
- Animate the color transition when hovering over the links!
- Add small buttons/links next to each section heading and make the sections collapsible (using jQuery).
